The home of nerdy egg chasing, Prem de la Prem has been a sanctuary for those with little actual rugby ability or frankly knowledge since 2020. 

This website aims to document the history of the league, past winners, wooden spoon recpients and if nothing else - act as a repository for the insane amount of stats our chief statistical officer, Gary, produces.

This website should be updated at least once a week with blog posts covering the stats, and feature a league table (once Oli works out how to build one).
