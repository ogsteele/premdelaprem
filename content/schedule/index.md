      title: League Structure
      subtitle: Conferences & Playoffs
      text: For the '23-'24 season a conference platform, followed by playoffs for the championship and the wooden spoon have been included. <br /> Rounds 1-15 will be for the intra-conference league system (see league scoring below), then from Round 16 the playoffs begin. Teams ranked 1st-4th in each conference enter the championship playoff at the quarter final and teams ranked 5th-6th enter the sacko braket. <br /> Traditionally only a semi-final has been included, however to include more teams in the end of season playoffs quarter-finals have been introduced this year. **Essentially, finishing out of the bottom two in your conference places you into the championship playoff, but a higher conference ranking gives you an easier run to the final.** <br />  <br />
