Morning all, 

Quick announcement; today we have expanded our board to introduce a new, and much needed role to assist 

As you will all appreciate, perhaps those having competed in previous years more so than others, this league is a complex business. Many rules exists and whilst our CEO Daniel does a wonderful job of enforcing these rules, it has come to our attention that we've not actually written down these rules anywhere ... 

To rectify this issue, and to conserve, monitor and record the rules that govern the league and the social society around it we have appointed a new board member to oversee this process after a short internal application process (*he asked*). Their initial role will be to document the League Constitution and will update the league with progress in due course. 

**Please welcome our new board member Jack Saunders to the role of Chief Pedantry Officer. It is anticipated that he will fit in perfectly, due to the role being very much in keeping with his character anyway ...**

All the best,   
*Commissioner Lesshit*
