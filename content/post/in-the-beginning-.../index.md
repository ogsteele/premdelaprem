Evening all, 

Couple of minor points I wanted to get across before the league kicks off ... 


## Prem de la Prem Website

New this year, this website aims to be the home from home for the *Prem de la Prem* this year and in future years. The beauty of this site is that it's independent of the league system/data provider we end up using so should be able to carry over each year. If nothing else, offers a place for our CSO Gary's stats and weekly commentary to really thrive rather than getting lost in the league. 

Additionally, as I developed this website entirely myself we're not limited to another web providers constraints of what goes on the page. ie, **if you want something new on the website, let me know and i'll see if it can be done! This is your website ultimately.**

## Punishments

As ever, **the person who finishes last in the leauge will need to do some form of punishment, and have the punishment evidenced in the group before the next league lockout** (just before the first match of the weekend I believe). Watch out for our Chief Enforcement Officer (CEO) Dan, as he'll as ever be on the prowl - doubly as at mandatory league socials ...

## Mid season rugby match

Really enjoyed a season or two most of us dragging ourselves up to Leicester to see Alex; but more importantly watch a match together. With the rec so close to most of us, Bath/Bristol not being that far from Jack and Alex still in Leicester and COVID being less of a bitch than before, **I think we should really think about getting to another match together. Any suggestions? **

Enjoy the website, enjoy the league, enjoy watching Jamie's punishments. 

All the best,   
*Commissioner Lesshit*
