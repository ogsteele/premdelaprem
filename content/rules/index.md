      title: League Structure
      subtitle: Conferences & Playoffs
      text: For the '23-'24 season a conference platform, followed by playoffs for the championship and the wooden spoon have been included. <br /> Rounds 1-15 will be for the intra-conference league system (see league scoring below), then from Round 16 the playoffs begin. Teams ranked 1st-4th in each conference enter the championship playoff at the quarter final and teams ranked 5th-6th enter the sacko braket. <br /> Traditionally only a semi-final has been included, however to include more teams in the end of season playoffs quarter-finals have been introduced this year. **Essentially, finishing out of the bottom two in your conference places you into the championship playoff, but a higher conference ranking gives you an easier run to the final.** <br />  <br /> ![screen reader text](league_structure.jpg "League Structure")

      text: Through Rounds 1-15, teams will play eachother a total of three times (*think 'best of three' for proper bragging rights*) to determine the conference standings before entry to the playoffs. <br /> Teams will score points based on the table below, following standard premiership rugby points standards; <br />   <br /> ![screen reader text](league_scoring.jpg "League Scoring") <br />  <br />  <br /> Teams scores will be managed through superbru and updated 24-48 hours after the last game finishes, at which point this league will be updated. Points values are shown below, and lifted from [Superbru](https://www.superbru.com/premiershiprugbyfantasy/how_to_play.php#tab=scoring) (correct as of 09.10.23); ![screen reader text](superbru_1.jpg "Superbru Scoring") <br /> ![screen reader text](superbru_2.jpg "Superbru Scoring Continued")

      text: Two finalists from the prior year (Sam & Gary) have been automatically seeded into seperate groups, whilst the rest of the teams have simply been randomised between the two conferences. This system to set up the league was decided to be fairest due to two absentee players last year (Alex & Oli) and two new players joining the league (Luke & Steggles). <br />   <br /> ![screen reader text](conferences.jpg " ") <br /> Conferences drawn on 07.10.23 @ 19:11 via ChatGPT, witnessed by OGS & GB.
